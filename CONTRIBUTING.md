```

### 4️⃣ Make Your Changes

Update the code, fix bugs, or improve the interface! All contributions are welcome.

### 📦 Embed Images as Base64 (For Portability)

To maintain **portability** and reduce external file dependencies, please embed image assets (such as icons or cursors) directly in the code using base64 encoding.

Use the following code snippet to convert an image to a base64 string:

```python
import base64

image_path = r"path\to\your\image\here.png"

with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")
print(encoded_string)
```

Then, paste the resulting string into the code and decode it at runtime using `base64.b64decode()`.

> 📁 **Important**: Even though the image is embedded in the code, still include the original image file in the `assets/` folder. This helps with development, testing, and future edits.

### 5️⃣ Format Your Code (Style Guidelines)

Ensure your code follows standard Python formatting conventions:

#### 🐍 Python Formatting

* Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).
* Follow **PEP 8** for general style.
* Use **f-strings** for formatting text.
* Avoid hardcoding paths—use `os.path.join()` for file operations.
* Run **Black** to format your code before committing:

  ```bash
  black .
  ```
* Add docstrings to your functions using Sphinx/reStructuredText (reST) style. Follow PEP 257 for structure and consistency.
