**Roblox Profile Manager** is a **Python-based application** that enables users to easily manage and switch between multiple Roblox profiles. It uses **Selenium** for browser automation and **Tkinter** for creating a graphical interface. The application allows users to save, load, create, delete, and log into multiple profiles using **ROBLOSECURITY tokens**. It is recommended to use this script in combination with **MultiBloxy** for running multiple Roblox instances simultaneously.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers:  
- Please note that profiles are encrypted using Fernet encryption, with a key generated and stored in the root directory upon the program's first launch. While Fernet provides strong encryption, it is important to understand that the security of your encrypted data depends on the safety of the encryption key. If an attacker gains access to profiles.json and the key.key files, they could potentially decrypt your profiles. The user assumes full responsibility for any risks associated with storing tokens and using this program. The code is provided "as-is," and the author disclaims all liability for any damages, losses, or issues arising from its use. By proceeding, you acknowledge and accept these risks.

- This application includes **MultiBloxy** as an optional feature, allowing you to run multiple Roblox instances simultaneously. Please note that **Xelvanta** is **not** affiliated with **MultiBloxy**, and **MultiBloxy** does not endorse **Xelvanta** or this project in any capacity. **MultiBloxy** is distributed under the [MIT License](MultiBloxy/LICENSE).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

Here are some common issues you may encounter during setup:

- **Launching a new instance of Roblox closes the previous instance**: Ensure that **MultiBloxy.exe** is running before attempting to manage multiple instances of Roblox.

If **MultiBloxy.exe** is not found, make sure the executable exists in the **MultiBloxy/** folder under the project directory. If not, download it from the [MultiBloxy GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zgoly/MultiBloxy).

### Issues with the Selenium WebDriver
